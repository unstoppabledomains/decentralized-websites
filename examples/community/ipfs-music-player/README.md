## Making it your own

* `/src/App.jsx` 
    * Contains the location to your song, album art, title, and artist.
* `/public/index.html`
    * Contains the title, description, and favicon for your website.

### Test your website

#### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deploy your website

#### 1. `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
